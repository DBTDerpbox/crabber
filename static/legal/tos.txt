To submit content, browse this website, and otherwise make use of this service
you must agree to the terms specified in this document. Failure to do so will
result in a denial of service.

Crabber, at this moment, does not use the user's email address for anything
other than the sign-up and login pages. It is kept on record both for this
purpose and for if we need to contact a user for any reason listed below.

Crabber reserves the right to claim back usernames that have already been taken
if the situation demands it. (For instance, if the president of the United
States joins the site and wants his username, we would probably allow that.) If
your username is claimed back we will notify you, and be in touch to arrange a
new one for you. You may be given notice in advance but this is not guaranteed.

Follow the rules. Breaking a rule may result in banishment. The site, its
creator, and other moderators reserve the right to suspend or terminate your
account at our discretion. An IP-ban or alternative action may be taken if
deemed necessary.

The basic rules are as follows:

  * Respect other users.
  * Follow the law of both your own country and of the United States.
  * Do not reveal personal information of others. It's recommended not to
    reveal your own, but that's up to you unless we deem it inappropriate.
  * Hate speech is not allowed. This includes slurs, "dog whistling", and
    otherwise hateful or slanderous behaviour.
  * Incel, alt-right, KKK, Nazi, and other hateful ideologies are not allowed.
    Go back to Parler and complain how this is an SJW site. We don't care.
  * This site does not support "cancel culture". Give people the benefit of the
    doubt and don't brigade them for their minor mistakes. People grow and this
    site encourages that.

Rules can and will be modified and/or appended. Continued usage of this site,
its services, and content implies agreement of this document both in its
current state and its ongoing ammendments regardless of whether you have been
notified of said ammendments.

If you see someone breaking the rules or if you feel we have omitted a rule
that is negatively affecting your experience, please get in touch with a site
administrator.
