As you begin implementing a feature or fixing a bug, please create or update the relevant issue on GitHub so that others know you're actively working on it. 

Before making a pull request, please test these changes extensively on both desktop and mobile devices and invite other users to do the same. The master branch is running live on crabber.net, unstable code or broken HTML can not be tolerated. Error messages scare users.

Be friendly and have fun! This is a silly project, don't take yourself too seriously. Peace.
