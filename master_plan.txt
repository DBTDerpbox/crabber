Twitter clone. Name: Crabber.

Users are called Crabs. Tweets are called molts. We are sticking to the original length of 140 characters rather than
the revised 240. Hashtags are called Crabtags and use the % sign (for no reason). They must be less than or equal to 16
characters. Because people may want to use the percent sign normally, you can escape the tag using a backslash, e.g. \%
to cancel it out. We'll still use @ for mentions because it makes sense.

------ Things to remember upon site design ------

  * For every count, search, and display you do, verify that nothing you're dealing with pertains to a Crab or Molt that
    has since been deleted. This information will be confusing, strange, and otherwise misleading to the user. In some
    situations, it is okay to display "This {object} has been deleted." as an alternative to just omitting it.

------ TODO: ------
  * User popovers
  * Notif stacking
  * Turn molt content links into anchors
  * DOCUMENTATION and refactoring
  * ~~Figure out how to add class type hints before declaration~~ USE BACKTICKS AROUND CLASS NAME
  * Quote-molting
  * Moderation helper -- gives content a profanity score and page displays highest-ranking things for the moderator to 
    either approve or take action on.
